Functional Requirements
--
### Requirements_1
### Description: 
The system shall automatically sort questions into distinct categories to help developers quickly locate relevant training data.

### Assumptions:

- Categorizing questions will save developers time in finding specific training data.
- Developers rely on automated categorization for faster workflow.


### Validation Plan:

- Verify that the system categorizes questions based on predefined tags.
- Conduct tests to ensure the categorization process is accurate and complete.

###  Tasks:

- [ ]  Define and finalize category schemas (e.g., by topic or type).
- [ ]  Develop an algorithm to sort questions into categories automatically.
- [ ] Test the algorithm using sample datasets to ensure accuracy.


### Requirements_2
### Description: 
The system shall allow developers to test their knowledge without immediately displaying answers, supporting self-assessment and reinforcement of learning.

### Assumptions:

- Delayed access to answers will encourage developers to actively engage in self-assessment.
- Developers prefer a self-paced testing experience.

### Validation Plan:

- Test whether answers are only displayed after user confirmation.
- Gather feedback from developers to confirm this improves their learning process.

### Tasks:

- [ ]  Develop a user interface that hides answers initially.
- [ ] Implement a confirmation mechanism to reveal answers when requested.
- [ ] Test the self-testing functionality with a user sample.
